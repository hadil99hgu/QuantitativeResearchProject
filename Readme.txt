Quantitative Research Project : Analysis of the predictive power of a signal
The aim of this exercise is to test a data source which claims to be predictive of future returns of the SP500 index (use SPY as a proxy).
The “signal” in the table is received at the end of the day (that is to say, contemporaneous with the SPY price shown in the table). We do not have a prior conviction about the forecast horizon over which the signal is effective.
The first step in this endeavor is data cleaning. Identify any errors in the data, flag them with a note, and suggest a corrected value or if advisable, you may choose to ignore them for purposes of your analysis. 

Requested Output: Present an analysis of the predictive power of this signal, with your conclusions about its viability and shortcomings, and your brief recommendation to a Portfolio Manager. This may take the form of a brief note with any relevant graphs.
